# Hypixel - Bouncing Balls

Write a program which displays, in 2D, circles of various sizes bouncing between themselves within the bounds of the window. 

When the program starts:
- 20 circles have to be spawned at random locations within the window (size of 1000px by 400px);
- With a random radius between 20px and 30px;
- With a random velocity between 70px/s and 80px/s;
- With a random direction. 

When a circle collides with another circle or with an edge of the window, it must reflect on it.

Please include the following features, which should be able to be enabled and disabled independently:
- Randomised mass per ball
- Gravity

A skeleton of the program is provided to help you get started, feel free to change the code as you see fit. Try to optimise the code as best as possible while keeping it readable, even if this means modifying the existing skeleton.
